    <p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        I am a senior at Tufts University studying Computer Science and <span data-link="stsWikipedia"></span>, mainly
        because I'm interested in how
        people and technology interact.
        At Tufts, I direct the <span data-link="tassaDev"></span> and <span data-link="lantern" data-short></span>.
        My research experience is in algorithmic fairness and moral reasoning in AI. I am also currently writing a
        thesis on data privacy and AI.
        My career interests are in AI governance and policy.

            This short piece argues that for companies to really succeed in their AI
            implementations, they must do so from the ground up, listening to their workers
            instead of imposing new tech restrictions from the top.

            For my GenAI for Social Impact final project, we developed TIPS, a Chrome
            extension that uses an LLM to help neurodivergent users interpret tone and
            nuance in online text. The tool reduces interpretation time for users by 18.2%.
            We also ran a systematic evaluation to benchmark model bias, testing whether
            LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3, LLaMA 3, etc.) alter their "bluntness" ratings of
            text after being told the author is autistic.

            This is a brief demo policy memo I wrote about an AI-based cyber attack called

            recommendation to OpenAI and I outlined a few ways the organization could tackle
            the problem.

            This is an essay published in The Lantern’s Vol. 2 Spring Magazine analyzing the
            documentary "All Light, Everywhere". I argue that surveillance technologies like
            police body cameras are not objective tools, but systems whose technical design
            choices (field-of-view, lens distortion) inherently frame reality and reproduce
            bias under a false veil of truth.

            This paper explores why "fair" algorithms can still perpetuate discrimination. I
            investigate how mathematical fairness metrics (like demographic parity and
            equalized odds) are fundamentally incompatible and can haphazardly reduce
            important sociotechnical context, using the classic COMPAS recidivism algorithm
            as a case study.

            challenges of defining values and the concrete technical hurdles like reward
            hacking and distributional shifts, arguing that robust safety guardrails must be
            prioritized over rapid, unchecked progress.
