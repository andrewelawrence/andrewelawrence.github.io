## A little bit more

There's a little bit more to me than that.

Most recently I have been interested in the economies of information and its relation to concentration of power, the politics of AI Safety + Ethics, 

I'm trying my hand at microblogging (see /blog) and using this website as a space to publish snapshots of my thinking and unfinished works

I'm starting an interdisciplinary senior thesis on privacy-preserving machine learning and distributed learning as a means to decentralize SOTA model training and preserve democratic access to models. 

## My background 
My interests have always laid at the interesction between technology and politics. In high school I was a nationally competitive Model UN delegate and leader of . At the same time I was an avid programmer and builder: everything from trash-picked bikes and hacked-together laptops to custom firmware for my 3d-printer.

My academic interests formalized when I examined algorithmic fairness and machine bias from a sociotechnical perspective.

Then worked on mapping arguments via argument mining and NLP as a function to express latent reasoning structures and align AI reasoning chains through these norms.
