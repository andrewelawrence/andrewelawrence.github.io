Who am I? Read no further:
> I am a **senior at Tufts University** studying **Computer Science** and **Science, Technology, and Society** (STS). I direct the [Tufts AI Safety Student Association](https://tassa.dev) (TASSA) and [the Lantern](https://tuftslantern.org). My career interests are in AI governance and policy, and my research has most recently been focused on moral reasoning in AI and privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning.
